# BCG GAMMA Virtual Internship 
Customer Churn Prediction 
Open-Access Data Science & Advanced Analytics Virtual Experience Program from BCG GAMMA

The client in this project is PowerCo which is a major gas and electricity utilities company. Its customer segmentations are corporate, Small and Medium Enterprise (SME), and residential customers. PowerCo has suffered from a significant profit loss due to customer churn (the situation when the customer stops using the service/product) in power-liberalization of the energy market in Europe and especially from Small and Medium Enterprise. The company has been endeavored to drive churn reduction within SME segment. To help PowerCo better understand the situation and have a suitable strategy, BCG has offered such great business context for us. The goal is to diagnose the source of churning SME customers.

Indeed, PowerCo has provided three data csv files:
-	Historical customer data (16 095 observations): data about customers such as usage, signup date, forecasted usage, gross and net margin etc.
-	Historical pricing data (193 001 observations): price of energy and power for first, second and third period.
-	Churn indicator (16 095 observations): 1 is churned and 0 is not churned for each customer (through customer id).
